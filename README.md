# Project Catwalk
Front-end capstone project for Hack Reactor

## Team Objective
Deliver a fully functional web application that meets the specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders. Work together on a single code base by dividing up the work among team members but working collaboratively to produce a single front end application. Integrate your front end with the existing API for the product, and demonstrate your working application at the end of the project timeline.

## Setup Intructions
1. Clone the repository to your local system.
2. Run `npm install` on the command line from inside the repository's root directory.
3. Use the following commands to execute the various scripts:
   - `npm start` to initialize the server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enter watch mode; [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) will automatically restart the server if it detects any relevant file changes.
   - `npm run dev` to create a development build of the application and enter watch mode; [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) will automatically rebuild the application if it detects any relevant file changes.
   - `npm run build` to create a production build of the application, ideal for measuring performance with [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse); watch mode will not be enabled.
   - `npm test` to execute all component tests and enter watch mode; [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) will automatically rerun all tests if it detects any relevant file changes.
